### Linting

To keep the same code style, we adopted [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) to maintain our code quality.

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

### Test

Once you created a branch and done with development, you must perform a test running `npm run test` command before you push code to a remote repository.

```bash
$ npm run test
```
Running a `npm run test` command will start [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) tests via [Karma-runner](https://karma-runner.github.io/).
